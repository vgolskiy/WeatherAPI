# Weather API
Work with external weather forecast service "Open Weather API".

Goals are: 
- return the weather conditions in selected area (snow, rain, etc);
- approximate whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside;
- define whether there are any weather alerts in selected area;
- show the weather conditions related to the alert if any.
